Conservativity Violation Correction Algorithm
---

The algorithm was implemented in Python3 using libraries RDFLib and Owlready2 version 0.13
Both libraries may be installed with pip.

To install pip for Python3 with apt package manager, run:
sudo apt install python3-pip

To install RDFLib, run:
python3 -m pip install rdflib

to install Owlready 2 version 0.13, run:
python3 -m pip install owlready2==0.13

RUNNING THE ALGORITHM
To run the script, pass the files for the alignment and both ontologies as parameters.
The alignment file must be in the RDF format, and the ontologies in OWL2.
Note that the order of the ontologies must be the same as it appears in the alignment file.

The execution command is:
python3 conservativity.py <alignment file> <ontology 1 file> <ontology 2 file>
